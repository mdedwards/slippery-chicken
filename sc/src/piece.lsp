;;; Purpose:          Implementation of the piece class which holds all the
;;;                   note information for a whole piece in the form of
;;;                   sections (possibly subsections), which then contain
;;;                   player-sections, sequenzes and rthm-seq-bars.

;;; ****m* piece/insert-bar
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Insert a rthm-seq-bar object into an existing piece object.
;;;
;;; NB: As this is a post-generation editing method when used with this class,
;;;     the rthm-seq-bar object must consist of event objects (with pitches),
;;;     not just rhythm objects. If used to insert a bar into an isolated
;;;     rthm-seq object (not a sequenz object), the inserted rthm-seq-bar could
;;;     then consist of rhythm objects rather than events.
;;;
;;; NB: Slippery chicken does not check to ensure that a new bar is inserted
;;;     for each player at a given point; this is up to the user. 
;;;
;;; NB: The user must call the update-slots method to ensure that changes to
;;;     the num-bars slot etc. are reflected in the given slippery-chicken
;;;     object.
;;; 
;;; ARGUMENTS
;;; - A piece object.
;;; - A rthm-seq-bar object.
;;; - An integer that is the bar-number within the rthm-seq-bar object before
;;;   which the new bar is to be inserted.
;;; - NB: The optional arguments are actually required for use with this class. 
;;; 
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; NB: The optional arguments are actually required for use with this class.  
;;; - An integer that is the section of in which the bar is to be inserted. 
;;; - The ID of the player into whose part the new bar is to be added.
;;; - An integer that is the number of the sequenz object into which the bar is
;;;   to be inserted. This is one-based. 
;;; - A list of integers that are the curve for a pitch-seq object to be
;;;   applied to the bar that is to be inserted.

;;; SAR Fri May  4 12:40:52 BST 2012: Added robodoc entry
;;; SAR Fri May  4 12:55:10 BST 2012: Deleted some of MDE's original comment
;;; here as it's been taken nearly verbatim into the robodoc below.

;;; MDE original comment:
;;; This is the primary method that should be called to access instrument
;;; sequences as it handles the case where an instrument doesn't play in a
;;; sequence. 
;;;
;;; When the given player sits this sequence out and create-rest-seq is t,
;;; create a rest sequence (one where there's the correct number and type of
;;; bars but only rest bars) based on a sequence in one of the playing
;;; instruments.
;;;
;;; This is the method called when the player is mentioned in the section but
;;; sits a sequence out (with nil). 

;;; ****m* piece/get-nth-sequenz
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Get the sequenz object from a specified section of a piece object by
;;; specifying a position index and a player.
;;;
;;; NB: This is the primary method for accessing player sequences, as it
;;;     handles cases in which a player doesn't play in a sequence, and it is
;;;     called automatically by slippery-chicken. 
;;;
;;;     When the specified player has no note events in the specified sequence
;;;     and the optional argument <create-rest-seq> is set to T, this method
;;;     creates a rest sequence (one that consists of the correct number of
;;;     bars with the right time signatures, but in which the bars are only
;;;     rest bars) based on a simultaneous sequence in one of the playing
;;;     instruments.  
;;;
;;; ARGUMENTS
;;; - A piece object.
;;; - The ID of the section in from which the sequenz object is to be
;;;   returned. 
;;; - The ID of the player from whose part the sequenz object is to be
;;;   returned. 
;;; - An integer that is the index (position) of the desired sequenz object
;;;   within the given section. This number is 0-based.
;;; 
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; - T or NIL to indicate whether to convert sequenz objects that are NIL
;;;   (i.e., the specified player has no events in the specified sequenz) to
;;;   sequenz objects consisting of full-bar rests. T = create rest sequences.
;;;   Default = T. NB: This argument is already called by slippery-chicken with
;;;   a value of T, so has no effect when used as a post-generation editing
;;;   method and can be thus considered for internal use only.
;;; 
;;; RETURN VALUE
;;; Returns a sequenz object.
;;; 
;;; EXAMPLE

;;; MDE Mon Jul 23 20:20:10 2012 -- from ticket #386 re. getting instrument
;;; changes on rest sequenzes: the problem is that sc-make-sequence sets the
;;; instrument-change slot of an event but if a player sits out a seq we'll
;;; have to set it in get-nth-sequenz when cloning empty.  Remember that
;;; instrument-changes are specified in the change map as occuring at the start
;;; of a sequence (bar numbers are not given in the map) and instruments can't
;;; be changed mid-sequence.

;;; we should be able to set an instrument-change at the beginning of sequence
;;; by passing the change to piece::get-nth-sequenz as it's called from
;;; piece::add-rest-sequenzes.  In order to do that though we'll need to call
;;; get-current-instrument-for-player, which will need the sc object; do this
;;; from piece::add-rest-sequenzes

;;; having done the above, the instrument-change is being set in the first
;;; event but this is not getting transferred over to the actual event, rather
;;; the data of the event, almost certainly because sclist::(setf data) is
;;; calling verify-and-store and thus cloning the events or something.

;;; after setting in add-rest-sequenzes, the instrument-change shows up in the
;;; first event of the first bar, as well as in the data list of the bar (from
;;; the sclist) but is then deleted by the time the sc structure is finally
;;; created, so is it being deleted after the call to add-rest-sequenzes in
;;; sc-make-piece, eg. in update-slots? no, turns out init was calling
;;; cleanup-rest-bars which was re-creating rest-bars in rest-seqs; added a
;;; test there to make sure it doesn't force-rest-bar when we already have one,
;;; but also in force-rest-bar made sure any instrument-change slot in the
;;; first event is being copied over when creating the new rest bar.  this
;;; meant the ins-change was being set but still not used: had to edit

;;;
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Go through the sequences and rebar according to the first one that has the
;;; least number of bars (but following the player hierarchy).
;;; 
;;; ARGUMENTS 
;;; - A piece object (usually provided by calling from the slippery-chicken
;;;   class)
;;;
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; - A list of player IDs from the given piece object, ordered in terms of
;;;   importance i.e. which instrument's bar structure should take precedence.
;;; 
;;; NB: The optional arguments are actually required in this class (not in
;;;     slippery-chicken) but the rebar-fun is not yet used.
;;; 
;;; RETURN VALUE  
;;; Always T.

;;; ****m* piece/delete-sequenzes
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Delete one or more consecutive sequenz objects from a given piece object by
;;; specifying any bar number within the first sequenz object to be deleted. 
;;;
;;; This method deletes the whole sequenz object which contains the bar with a
;;; given number.  
;;;
;;; NB: This method only deletes the sequenz object for the specified player,
;;;     so the remaining players will have a different structure, making MIDI
;;;     or printable output impossible. The user must be sure that each section
;;;     has the same number of sequenzes of identical time-signature structure
;;;     in each section.
;;;
;;; NB: The user must call the update-slots method to ensure that changes to
;;;     the NUM-BARS slot etc. are reflected in the given slippery-chicken
;;;     object.
;;; 
;;; ARGUMENTS
;;; - A piece object.
;;; - An integer that is the number of the bar for which the containing sequenz
;;;   is to be deleted. 
;;; - The ID of the player from whose part the sequenz is to be deleted.  
;;; 
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; - An integer that is the number of consecutive sequenz objects to delete,
;;;   including the first sequenz indicated by the <bar-num> argument. 
;;;   Default = 1.
;;; 
;;; RETURN VALUE
;;; Returns T.
;;; 
;;; EXAMPLE
#|
;;; Print the number of sequenz objects contained in section 2 of each player's ; ; ;
;;; part, delete two sequenz objects from each part in that section, and print ; ; ;
;;; the number of sequenz objects again to see the difference. Update the slots ; ; ;
;;; and call cmn-display for printable output. ; ; ;
