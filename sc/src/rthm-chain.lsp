;;; Project:          slippery chicken (algorithmic composition)
;;;
;;; Purpose:          Algorithmic generation of rthm-seqs that include
;;;                   slower-moving counterpoint and a means to control
;;;                   activity development through curves.  Here we generate a
;;;                   rthm-seq-map and its associated palette algorithmically.
;;;
;;;                   Say we have 9 irregular 1 beat duration patterns; these
;;;                   would enter in the sequence defined by (procession x 9)
;;;                   where x would be the number of patterns to generate. 
;;; 
;;;                   Rests are inserted at regular but changing intervals e.g
;;; 
;;;                   3x every 2 beats (6)
;;;                   2x every 3 beats (6)
;;;                   3x every 5 beats (15)
;;;                   2x every 8 beats (16)
;;; 
;;;                   e, q, and q. rests are used by default, in a sequence
;;;                   determined by a recurring-event instance.
;;; 
;;;                   In order to make music that 'progresses' we have curves
;;;                   with y values from 1-10 indicating how much activity
;;;                   there should be: 1 would mean only 1 in 10 beats would
;;;                   have notes in/on them, 10 would indicate that all do.  We
;;;                   use the patterns given in
;;;                   activity-levels::initialize-instance, where 1 means
;;;                   'play', 0 means 'rest'.  There are three examples of each
;;;                   level so that if we stick on one level of activity for
;;;                   some time we won't always get the same pattern: these
;;;                   will instead be cycled through.
;;; 
;;;                   A slower moving (bass) line is also added that is made up
;;;                   of 2 or 3 beat groups---if the activity curve indicates a
;;;                   rest, then the whole 2-3 beat group is omitted.
;;; 
;;;                   There are also 'sticking points' where a rhythm will be
;;;                   repeated a certain number of times (either s, e, e., or q
;;;                   by default).  Sticking happens after rests.  This can be
;;;                   controlled with an activity envelope too, also indicating
;;;                   one of the 10 patterns above (but also including 0).  A 0
;;;                   or 1 unit here would refer to a certain number of repeats
;;;                   (1) or none (0).  How many repeats could be determined by
;;;                   something like: (procession 34 '(2 3 5 8 13) :peak 1
;;;                   :expt 3) There's always a slower group to accompany the
;;;                   sticking points: simply the next in the sequence,
;;;                   repeated for as long as we stick
;;; 
;;;                   The harmonic-rthm curve specifies how many slower-rthms
;;;                   will be combined into a rthm-seq (each rthm-seq has a
;;;                   single harmony).  The default is 2 bars (slower-rthms)
;;;                   per rthm-seq.

;;; ****m* rthm-chain/rthm-chain-gen
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Generate a chain of rhythms using the procession function (internally). 
;;; 
;;; The basic algorithm for generating a rthm-chain object of two parts is as
;;; follows: The user provides an arbitrary number of 1-beat rthms (e.g. s s
;;; (e)) and 2-3 beat slower-moving counterpoints. The method generates a
;;; sequence from these using the procession function. Next the activity curve
;;; is applied to this, and after that the insertion of rests. Then the
;;; 'sticking points' are generated: These come after the rests, and the
;;; activity curves applied to these count inserted rests not seqs or beats.
;;; 
;;; NB: Rests are put into the given rthm-seq object mid-sequence, so sticking
;;;     points won't come directly after the rests, rather, at the end of the
;;;     seq.
;;; 
;;; The activity curves that turn notes into rests will be queried every beat,
;;; so if an activity level is changed, the method won't wait until the end of
;;; the previous level's ten beats.
;;; 
;;; NB: This method is not generally called by the user (though it can be of
;;;     course); rather, it's called by the init function.
;;; 
;;; ARGUMENTS 
;;; - A rthm-chain object.
;;;
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; keyword arguments:
;;; - :rests. T or NIL to indicate whether rests are to be automatically
;;;   inserted. T = automatically insert. Default = T.
;;; - :stick. T or NIL to indicate whether to generate the sticking points. T =
;;;   generate sticking points. Default = T.
;;; - :num-beats. NIL or an integer to indicate how many beats are to be used
;;;   for the algorithm. NB: The method will generate considerably more beats

;;; ****m* rthm-chain/add-voice
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Add a new voice to an existing rthm-chain object based on the rhythmic
;;; material and slot values already contained in that object.
;;;
;;; The main rthm-chain algorithm generates only two voices. Rather than
;;; generate further voices in the same fashion by which the first two were
;;; created, this method uses the already created rthm-seqs in the given
;;; rthm-chain object to create a new voice. 
;;;
;;; The challenge here is that each rthm-seq potentially has its own time
;;; signature structure: There could be a 2/4 bar followed by 5/4 then 3/16,
;;; for example, or any other combination of any meter. So the method first
;;; analyses the time-signature structure of the existing rthm-seqs and saves
;;; those with the same bar/meter structure together in the order in which they
;;; occur. When creating the extra voice then, the method actually starts ahead
;;; of the main voice by choosing <offset> number of similar rthm-seqs in
;;; advance.
;;; 
;;; ARGUMENTS 
;;; - A rthm-chain object.
;;; - The reference (key path) of the player within the given rthm-chain object
;;;   whose rthm-seq-map is to serve as the 'parent voice', e.g. '(1 cl).
;;; - A symbol that will be the ID of the new player.
;;;
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; - An integer that indicates an offset into the group of similar rthm-seq
;;;   objects from which the new voice is to begin. (The generated voice will
;;;   thus be ahead of the main voice). Default = 1.
;;; 
;;; RETURN VALUE  
;;; Returns T.

;;; ****f* rthm-chain/make-rthm-chain
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Create an instance of a rthm-chain object. The rthm-chain class enables the
;;; algorithmic generation of a rthm-seq-map (with just one section) and its
;;; associated rthm-seq-palette, which consists in turn of algorithmically
;;; generated rthm-seq objects.
;;;
;;; The rhythm-seq objects are made up of both faster material based on 1-beat
;;; groups and slower-moving counterpoint based on 2- or 3-beat groups.
;;;
;;; The rthm-chain class also allows for control of the degree of activity in
;;; the parts over time through user-specified envelopes.
;;;
;;; Rests are automatically inserted at regular but changing intervals.
;;;
;;; Specified 'sticking points' cause individual rhythms to be repeated a
;;; certain number of times. Sticking happens after rests and can also be
;;; controlled with an activity envelope. 
;;;
;;; NB: Because this method uses the procession method internally, each
;;;     collection of 1-beat-rthms and slower-rthms defined must contain at
;;;     least four items.
;;;
;;; NB: Since this method automatically inserts rests into the chains, the user
;;;     may like to implement the various tie-over-rests post-generation
;;;     editing methods. If this is done, the handle-ties method may also be
;;;     recommended, as the tie-over-rests methods only affect printed output
;;;     and not MIDI output.
;;;
;;; ARGUMENTS
;;; - A number, symbol, or string that is to be the ID of the new rthm-chain
;;;   object. 
;;; - An integer that is the number of beats to be generated prior to adding
;;;   additional material created from sticking points and the automatic
;;;   addition of rests.
;;; - A list with sublists of rhythms that are to be the 1-beat rhythms used to
;;;   construct the faster-moving material of the rthm-seq-palette. Each
;;;   sublist represents the repertoire of rhythms that will be used by the
;;;   procession method. Each sublist must contain the same number of rthms but
;;;   their number and the number of sublists is open. A transition will be
;;;   made from one group of rhythms to the next over the whole output
;;;   (i.e. not one unit to another within e.g. the 1-beat rhythms) according
;;;   to a fibonacci-transition method.
;;; - A list with sublists of 2-beat and 3-beat full bars of rhythms used to
;;;   construct the slower-moving counterpoint material of the
;;;   rthm-seq-palette. This will be turned into a rthm-chain-slow object, and
;;;   will therefore remain as lists of unparsed rhythms. Each sublist must
;;;   contain the same number of rthms but their number and the number of
;;;   sublists is open. A transition will be made from one group of rhythms to
;;;   the next over the whole output (i.e. not one unit to another within
;;;   e.g. the 1-beat rhythms) according to a fibonacci-transition method. 
;;;   NB: The rhythm units of slower-rthms must be expressed in single beats;
;;;   e.g., a 2/4 bar must consist of q+q rather than h. The consolidate-notes
;;;   method can be called afterwards if desired.
;;; 
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; keyword arguments:
;;; - :players. A list of two player IDs. When used in conjunction with a
;;;   slippery-chicken object (which is the standard usage), these must be IDs
;;;   as they are defined in that object's ENSEMBLE slot. The first player will
;;;   play the 1-beat rhythms, the second the slower rhythms.  
;;;   Default = '(player1 player2).
;;; - :section-id. An integer that will be used as the ID of the rthm-seq-map
;;;   created. NB: rthm-chain only creates rthm-seq-maps with one section,
;;;   making it possible to create several different rthm-seq-map objects for
;;;   different sections in the given piece, and requiring that these be
;;;   manually assigned IDs. Additionally, any ID given here must match an
;;;   existing ID within the other maps. Default = 1.
;;; - :activity-curve. A list of break-point pairs with y values from 1 to 10
;;;   indicating the amount of activity there should be over the course of the
;;;   piece. A value of 1 indicates that only 1 in 10 beats will have notes
;;;   in/on them, and a value of 10 indicates that all beats will have
;;;   notes. This process uses the patterns given in
;;;   activity-levels::initialize-instance, where 1 means 'play' and 0 means
;;;   'rest'. There are three templates for each level, so that if the curve
;;;   remains on one level of activity for some time it won't always return the
;;;   same pattern; these will be rotated instead. If the activity curve
;;;   indicates a rest for one of the slower-rhythms groups, the whole 2-3 beat
;;;   group is omitted. Default = '(0 10 100 10).
;;; - :do-rests. T or NIL to indicate whether to apply the automatic
;;;   rest-insertion algorithm. T = use. Default = T.
;;; - :rests. A list of rhythmic duration units from which the durations will
;;;   be drawn when using the automatic rest-insertion algorithm. The specified
;;;   rests are used in a sequence determined by a recurring-event
;;;   object. Default = '(e q q. w). NB: Each of these values must not resolve
;;;   to less than one-quarter of the beat basis, either alone or in
;;;   combination, as this could result in an attempt to create meters from
;;;   fractional beats (e.g. 3.25). An error message will be printed in such
;;;   cases.
;;; - :rest-cycle. A list of 2-item lists that indicate the pattern by which
;;;   rests of specific rhythmic durations will be selected from the RESTS slot
;;;   for automatic insertion. The first number of each pair is a 0-based
;;;   position referring to the list of rests in the RESTS slot, and the second
;;;   number is the number of times the rest at that particular position should
;;;   be inserted. (This number does not mean that the selected rest will be
;;;   inserted that many times at once, but rather that each consecutive time
;;;   the rest algorithm selects one rest to be inserted, it will insert that
;;;   specific rest, for the specified number of consecutive times.) For
;;;   example, (0 3) indicates that for the next three times that the rest
;;;   algorithm selects one rest to insert, it will select the rest located at
;;;   position 0 in the list of rests in the RESTS slot (e by default).
;;;   Default ='((0 3) (1 1) (0 2) (2 1) (1 1) (3 1)).
;;; - :rest-re. A list of 2-item lists that indicate the pattern by which rests
;;;   will be automatically inserted. The first number of each pair determines
;;;   how many events occur before inserting a rest, and the second number of
;;;   each pair determines how many times that period will be repeated. For
;;;   example, (2 3) indicates that a rest will be inserted every two events,
;;;   three times in a row. The list passed here will be treated as data for a
;;;   recurring-event object that will be repeatedly cycled through.  
;;;   Default = '((2 3) (3 2) (2 2) (5 1) (3 3) (8 1)).
;;; - :do-rests-curve. A list of break-point pairs with y values of either 0 or
;;;   1 indicating whether the do-rests algorithm is active or disabled. These
;;;   values are interpolated between each pair, with all values 0.5 and higher
;;;   being rounded up to 1 and all below 0.5 rounded to 0. Default = NIL.
;;; - :do-sticking. T or NIL to indicate whether the method should apply the
;;;   sticking algorithm. T = apply. Default = T.
;;; - :sticking-rthms. A list of rhythmic units that will serve as the rhythms
;;;   employed by the sticking algorithm. These are generated at initialization
;;;   if not specified here. NB: This list is used to create a list using the
;;;   procession algorithm at initialization, so it is best to apply something
;;;   similar to the default if not accepting the default. If a circular-sclist
;;;   object is provided here, it will be used instead of the default
;;;   procession. Default = '(e e e. q e s).
;;; - :sticking-repeats. A list of integers to indicate the number of
;;;   repetitions applied in sticking segments. When the values of this list
;;;   have been exhausted, the method cycles to the beginning and continues
;;;   drawing from the head of the list again. NB: This list is made into a
;;;   circular-sclist object when the given rthm-chain object is initialized
;;;   unless a circular-sclist object is explicitly provided.
;;;   Default = '(3 5 3 5 8 13 21).
;;; - :sticking-curve. A list of break-point pairs that acts as an activity
;;;   envelope to control the sticking, which always occurs after rests. As
;;;   with the activity curve, this curve can take y values up to 10, but also
;;;   allows 0. A y value of 0 or 1 here refers to either a specific number of
;;;   repeats (1) or none (0). The number of repeats may be determined, for
;;;   example, by use of the procession method, such as 
;;;   (procession 34 '(2 3 5 8 13) :peak 1 :expt 3). Every sticking point is
;;;   accompanied by a slower group, which is simply chosen in sequence and
;;;   repeated for the duration of the sticking period.
;;;   Default = '(0 2 100 2).
;;; - :do-sticking-curve. A list of break-point pairs that can be used,
;;;   alternatively, to control whether the sticking algorithm is being applied
;;;   or not at any given point over the course of the piece. The y values for
;;;   this curve should be between 0 and 1, and the decimal fractions achieved
;;;   from interpolation will be rounded. The 1 values resulting from this
;;;   curve will only be actively applied to if do-sticking is set to T.
;;;   Default = NIL.
;;; - :harmonic-rthm-curve. A list of break-point pairs that indicates how many
;;;   slower-rthms will be combined into one rthm-seq (each rthm-seq has a
;;;   single harmony). The default is 2 bars (slower-rthms) per rthm-seq,
;;;   i.e. '(0 2 100 2).
;;; - :split-data. NIL or a two-item list of integers that are the minimum and
;;;   maximum beat duration of bars generated. If NIL, the bars will not be
;;;   split. These values are targets only; the method may create bars of
;;;   different lengths if the data generated cannot be otherwise split.
;;;   NB: The values given here will apply to a different beat basis depending
;;;   on time signature of each individual bar, rather than on a consistent
;;;   beat basis, such as quarters or eighths. Since this method produces bars
;;;   of different lengths with time signatures of differing beat bases
;;;   (e.g. 16, 8, 4 etc.) before it applies the split algorithm, a minimum
;;;   value of 4, for example, can result in bars of 4/16, 4/8, 4/4 etc.
;;;   Default = '(2 5)
;;; - :1-beat-fibonacci. T or NIL to indicate whether the sequence of 1-beat
;;;   rhythms is to be generated using the fibonacci-transitions method or the
;;;   processions method. T = use fibonacci-transitions method. Default = NIL.
;;; - :slow-fibonacci. T or NIL to indicate whether the sequence of the slow
;;;   rhythms will be generated using the fibonacci-transitions method or the
;;;   processions method. This affects the order in which each 2- or 3-beat
;;;   unit is used when necessary, not the order in which each 2- or 3-beat
;;;   unit is selected; the latter is decided by the next element in the DATA
;;;   slot of the rthm-chain-slow object, which simply cycles through 
;;;   '(2 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 3 3). T = use fibonacci-transisitions method.
;;;   Default = NIL.
;;; 
;;; RETURN VALUE
;;; A rthm-chain object.

;;; MDE original comment:
;;; start with just 3 items/events and successively add new ones until a max of
;;; <items>--this can be a list or integer (must be a min of 4)

;;; ****f* rthm-chain/procession
;;; DATE
;;; 26-Jan-2010
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Generate a list of a specified length consisting of items extrapolated from
;;; a specified starting list. All elements of the resulting list will be
;;; members of the original list. 
;;;
;;; The method generates the new list by starting with the first 3 elements of
;;; the initial list and successively adding consecutive elements from the
;;; initial list until all elements have been added.
;;;
;;; ARGUMENTS
;;; - An integer that is the number of items in the list to be generated.
;;; - A list of at least 4 starting items or an integer >=4. If an integer is
;;;   given rather than a list, the method will process a list of consecutive
;;;   numbers from 1 to the specified integer.
;;; 
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; keyword arguments:
;;; - :peak. A decimal number >0.0 and <=1.0. This number indicates the target
;;;   location in the new list at which the last element is to finally occur,
;;;   whereby e.g. 0.7 = ~70% of the way through the resulting list. This is an
;;;   approximate value only. The last element may occur earlier or later
;;;   depending on the values of the other arguments. In particular, initial
;;;   lists with a low number of items are likely to result in new lists in
;;;   which the final element occurs quite early on, perhaps even nowhere near
;;;   the specified peak value. Default = 0.7.
;;; - :expt. A (decimal) number that indicates the "curve" that determines the
;;;   intervals at which each successive element of the initial list is
;;;   introduced to the new list. A higher number indicates a steeper
;;;   exponential curve. Default = 1.3.
;;; - :orders. The patterns by which the elements are added. The method
;;;   cyclically applies these orders, the numbers 1, 2, and 3 representing the
;;;   three least used elements at each pass. These orders must therefore
;;;   contain all of the numbers 1, 2, and 3, and those numbers only. 
;;;   Default = '((1 2 1 2 3) (1 2 1 1 3) (1 2 1 3)).
;;; 
;;; RETURN VALUE
;;; Returns two values, the first being the new list, with a secondary value
;;; that is a list of 2-item lists that show the distribution of each element
;;; in the new list.
;;;

;;; ****f* rthm-chain/hash-least-used
;;; DESCRIPTION
;;; Return the least used key in a hash table. This may be used to retrieve the
;;; number of times the keys have been used as indices, for example.
;;; 
;;; ARGUMENTS
;;; - A hash table. This must be a lisp hash table object whose keys are all
;;;   integers and whose values are all numbers.
;;; 
;;; OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
;;; keyword arguments:
;;; - :start. The lowest key value we'll test. Default = 0.
;;; - :end. The highest key value we'll test. Default = number of items in the
;;;   hash table.
;;; - :ignore. A list of keys to ignore when processing. NIL = process all
;;;   keys. Default = NIL. 
;;; - :auto-inc. T or NIL to determine whether the function will automatically
;;;   increment the count of the returned key. T = automatically increment. 
;;;   Default = T.
;;; 
;;; RETURN VALUE
;;; The hash least used.
;;;
